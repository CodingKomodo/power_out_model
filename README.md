### Prediction Problem and Type

**Prediction Problem:** Predicting the duration of power outages given data from the Purdue Outage dataset.  
**Type:** Regression

### Response Variable

The response variable is the duration of power outages, which represents the length of time a power outage persists. This variable was chosen because it is continuous quantitative data, and the goal is to predict the specific duration of outages.

### Features for Prediction

The features used for prediction should be the ones available and relevant at the time of predicting the outage duration. Features like geographical location, weather conditions, outage start time, utility company information, historical outage data, and any other relevant parameters available up to the point of making predictions should be considered. These might include:

1. Geographical location (State, City)
2. Weather conditions (Temperature, Precipitation, Storm Severity)
3. Time of day or year
4. Utility company information (Service area, past outage records)

### Evaluation Metric

The choice of evaluation metric should align with the nature of the regression problem. Common regression metrics include:


1. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
2. R-squared (Coefficient of determination)

The selection among these metrics should depend on the specific characteristics and requirements of the problem. For instance:

- **RMSE** RMSE is sensitive to outliers due to squaring differences, but it provides a better indication of how far off predictions are on average.
- **R-squared** measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. It indicates the goodness of fit of the model.

The choice among these metrics depends on the preference for handling different aspects of prediction accuracy (e.g., sensitivity to outliers, emphasis on larger errors, or explaining variance).

### Justification

For predicting outage durations, a regression model is appropriate as it deals with continuous quantitative data. RMSE, and R-squared are common metrics used for regression problems, each providing insights into different aspects of prediction accuracy. The choice of these metrics should consider factors like interpretability, sensitivity to outliers, and the specific goals of the prediction task.


Note: Make sure to justify what information you would know at the “time of prediction” and to only train your model using those features. For instance, if we wanted to predict your final exam grade, we couldn’t use your Project 5 grade, because Project 5 is only due after the final exam!


### Model Description:

1. **Type of Model:** RandomForestClassifier - This model is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) or the mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.
  
2. **Features in the Model:**

   a. **Quantitative Features:**
      - `N/A`
   
   b. **Ordinal Features:**
      - `ANOMALY.LEVEL`
      - `MONTH`
   
   c. **Nominal Features:**
      - `POSTAL.CODE`

  
### Encoding and Feature Transformation:

1. **Encoding:**
   - One-Hot Encoding was applied to the 'POSTAL.CODE' feature using `OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore')` within a `ColumnTransformer` to convert categorical data into a format suitable for machine learning models.

2. **Feature Transformation:**
   - No explicit feature transformation or scaling was applied to the other features, indicating they might have been considered in their original form during the modeling process.

### Performance Evaluation:

- **Interpretation of Performance:**
  - By using `y_test` and `prediction` obtained from `pl.predict(X_test)`, we were able to find an accuracy score of around 0.63.
  - Compare this accuracy score against the baseline or other models (if available).
  - Consider domain-specific implications and the cost of misclassification.
  
- **Considerations for Model Improvement:**
  - Experiment with different models (e.g., Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, etc.).
  - Tune hyperparameters using techniques like GridSearchCV to improve model performance.
  - Feature engineering: Extract more informative features or transform existing ones.
  
- **Domain Knowledge:**
  - Domain experts' input could be valuable in refining the model or feature selection.

Without the specific accuracy score or additional metrics, it's challenging to definitively categorize the model as "good." An "accurate" model highly depends on the problem's context, the data quality, feature selection, and domain understanding.

Consideration of these aspects will provide a clearer perspective on the model's effectiveness and guide improvements to achieve a better-performing model.
